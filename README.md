# thea_interpreter
I have this idea for something a little more ambitious, but I need to understand these things first before I jump into it. So, I'm making an interpreter (and maybe a compiler in the future) for a language I'm creating called Thea. Eventually, I will translate this knowledge into a new language called Cynthia.
